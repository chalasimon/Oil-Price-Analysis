# Oil Price Analysis
The main goal of this project is to analyze  how important events affect Brent oil prices.
This will focus on finding out how changes in oil prices are linked to big events like
political decisions, conflicts in oil-producing regions, global economic sanctions, and
changes in Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) policies. The aim is
to provide clear insights that can help investors, analysts, and policymakers understand
and react to these price changes better.
