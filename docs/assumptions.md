This document outlines the assumptions and limitations of the Oil Price Analysis project, which is crucial for understanding the context and constraints of the analysis performed.
### Assumptions
1. Change points align with major geopolitical/economic events.
2. Log returns are stationary for modeling.

### Limitations
1. **Causality**: Detected changes may correlate but not prove causation.
2. **Gradual Shifts**: Model may miss slow trends (e.g., shale revolution).
3. **Data Gaps**: Pre-2000s data may lack granularity.
